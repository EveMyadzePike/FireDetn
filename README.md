## Two public database addresses are linked in this database：

### 1. The dataset of "Efficient Model for Real-time Wildfire Detection in Complex Scenarios Based on Multi-head Attention Mechanism"

The dataset can be downloaded at this link：https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rlc6UEdDQCiVVBqOerUPk48C0OQ1_bR_/view?usp=sharing

  (1) Click the link above to download the wildfire data set.


### 2. The dataset of "A Drone Image-based Model for Automatically Detecting Objects in Maritime Search and Rescue Missions"

### 2.1 The original SeaDronesSee dataset can be downloaded from "https://seadronessee.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/dataset" by following two steps：

  (1) Click "Object Detection" in the link above.
  
  (2) Download "annotations" label file and "images" image file.
  
### 2.2 The "Redivided SeaDronesSee" dataset is still being uploaded because the dataset is too large.
